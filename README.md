# Nand2Tetris
This is inspired from a course on Coursera which explains how to build a custom modern day computer from the most basic logic gates

The course is split into 2 parts
1. The (1st part)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome] describes the hardware part predominantly
2. the (2nd part)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2/home/welcome] describes how the software is run on top of the hardware/Hack ALU that we built in the 1st part
